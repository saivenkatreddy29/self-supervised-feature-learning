1. Dataset : CIFAR 10, loaded from pytorch library

2. Main model : DINO

3. Models for ablation study:ViT, SimCLR, EfficientNet-B0

4. Code files:Python .ipynb files, 4 in total
DINO.ipynb , ViT.ipynb, simclr.ipynb,EfficientNet-B0 model

Note: Due to the computational constraints like limited runtime of google colab GPU,
We couldn't run all the algorithms in a single go,
We implemented each algorithm in a separate file on same GPU several times
